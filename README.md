# SQL Portfolio – Data Analysis

Hi, I’m currently learning SQL as part of my transition into a Data Analyst role.

This repository documents my SQL learning journey with practical examples of
data manipulation and querying using SQL.

## What I have learned so far

### Data Definition & Manipulation
- Creating tables with columns
- Inserting rows into tables
- Updating existing records
- Deleting records

### Querying Data
- SELECT and FROM
- Filtering with WHERE
- Sorting with ORDER BY
- Pattern matching with LIKE
- Logical operators (AND, OR)
- Limiting results with LIMIT

### Conditional Logic
- Using CASE statements inside SELECT queries

## Purpose of this Repository
This portfolio is meant to show my understanding of SQL fundamentals and my ability
to write clean, readable queries to answer data-related questions.

More advanced topics (aggregate functions, joins, etc.) will be added as I progress.
